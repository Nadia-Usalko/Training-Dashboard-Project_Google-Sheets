# Training Analysis Dashboard 

The dataset consists of synthetic data representing training sessions conducted within a company with branches across three regions. Please note that the data used in this analysis is made up and does not reflect real-world data.

To complete this project, the following tool was utilized:
- Google Sheets


## Trainings Analysis

This analysis leverages synthetic data to identify trends and potential areas for improvement in the company's training initiatives across different departments in three regional branches.

Training managers at each region maintain monthly updates on individual tabs within the Google Sheets document. The dashboard is linked to these tabs to provide an overarching summary of the data. The 2023 Progress tab displays visualizations and charts that highlight identified trends.
Purpose
The insights derived from this analysis are crucial for stakeholders to evaluate the effectiveness of training programs on team performance and the overall success of the company. The analysis helps pinpoint any gaps, such as:
- Sales targets not being met
- Negative feedback on workplace communication
Such insights are valuable for the training department to refine strategies for the following year.
